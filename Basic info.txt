Debounccing and Throttling 


Debounccing (Delayed sending of request)
Problem Statement :
so like we don't have calculte button , so whenever someone type something in the box
request goes out to backend to calculate and get back answer 

Now when we are typing it is continously sending requests to backend , putting load on it 

example like on amazon.com  , now if we start typing it gives us suggesstion on our search in bar
but if i start typing fast , it somehow knows he is typing let him type and after few seconds or
when he stops we can send request to backend 


Throttling is the same thing on the backend
